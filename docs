# Location SDK Documentation

This SDK allows you to check if a user's location is within the borders of a specified country.

## Available Functions

In the project directory, you can use the following function:

### `LocationSdk(Context context)`

Initialize the SDK with the context of your application.

#### Example:

```java
LocationSdk locationSdk = new LocationSdk(context);
```

### `isInCountry(String countryCode, LocationResultCallback callback)`

Check if the user's current location is within the specified country. Pass in the **country code** (e.g., "US") and provide a **callback** to handle the response.

#### Example:

```java
locationSdk.isInCountry("US", new LocationSdk.LocationResultCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(boolean success) {
        if (success) {
            // The user is within the specified country
        } else {
            // The user is outside the specified country
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(String errorMessage) {
        // Handle errors (e.g., location permission not granted, API failure, etc.)
    }
});
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies


## How It Works

1. **Fused Location Provider**: The SDK uses Google's **FusedLocationProviderClient** to get the current location (latitude and longitude) of the device.
2. **API Request**: The SDK sends the location data (longitude and latitude) along with the **country code** to the backend server.
3. **Server Validation**: The server checks whether the location is inside the borders of the country specified by the country code.
4. **Response**: The SDK will return either `true` or `false` depending on whether the location is inside the specified country.

## Example API Request:

```json
{
  "longitude": 34.0522,
  "latitude": -118.2437,
  "countryCode": "US"
}
```

## Example API Response:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Error Handling

The SDK provides error messages via the `onError` callback. Common error messages include:

- **Location permissions not granted**: The app does not have permission to access location.
- **Unable to fetch location**: The SDK failed to retrieve the user's location.
- **API call failed**: The request to the backend API failed.

## Customization

- **Location Accuracy**: The SDK uses a configurable location request. You can adjust the frequency and accuracy of location updates using the `LocationRequest` object.
- **API Base URL**: By default, the SDK uses a local development URL (`http://10.0.2.2:3000`). Make sure to replace this with your production API URL when deploying.
